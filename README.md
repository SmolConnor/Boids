# Instructions
Simply boot up the unity scene and enjoy the fishes.

# How it works
Based on a flocking script tutorial from the Unity website, the fish are calculating the coralation, seperation andalignment of the others and trying to match. Ehe fish have randomly selected colours and a random speed chosen from a min and max speed. Every so often food will spawn that the fish will move towards and eat, every third food spawns a new fish.
